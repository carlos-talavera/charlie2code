## Introduction

The [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence/) is a fascinating mathematical sequence, with applications that range from biology to informatics. In this article, we will explore how to apply TDD to implement a function that calculates the nth [Fibonacci](https://www.thoughtco.com/leonardo-pisano-fibonacci-biography-2312397) number. We will see how the development patterns known as [Green Bar Patterns](https://www.tddbuddy.com/references/green-bar-patterns.html), proposed by [Kent Beck](https://londonspeakerbureau.com/speaker-profile/kent-beck/), guide us to an effective solution.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence starts with the numbers 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on. This sequence, popularized in Europe by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci, is a classic example of exponential growth and it is found in various areas of study.

Our goal is to build a `fibonacci` function which, given an integer number `n`, returns the nth Fibonacci number. We use TDD not only to ensure that our implementation is correct, but also to illustrate the `Green Bar Patterns`.

## Green Bar Patterns

To keep the article brief, we will see the implementations and the tests will be understood from the examples.

### Fake Implementation

We start with a fake implementation to make a test pass quickly. For example, for `fibonacci(0)`, we simply return 0.

```ts
function fibonacci(number: number) {
  return 0;
}
```

### Triangulation

By adding more test cases, we use triangulation to refine our implementation. This pattern helps us to generalize the solution from specific cases. For example, we handle `fibonacci(1)` by returning 1 and then we verify that `fibonacci(2)` is the sum of the previous two.

```ts
function fibonacci(number: number) {
  if (number === 0) return 0;
  return 1;
}
```

This would work for `fibonacci(2)` because:

`fibonacci(2)` $=$ `1`

`fibonacci(2)` $=$ `fibonacci(1)` $+$ `fibonacci(0)` $=$ `1` $+$ `0` $=$ `1`

### Obvious Implementation

As we add more cases, we move on to a recursive implementation that reflects the mathematical definition of Fibonacci. This allows us to handle any number in the sequence.

```ts
export function fibonacci(number: number) {
  if (number === 0) return 0;
  if (number === 1) return 1;
  return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2);
}
```

It may seem odd that the obvious implementation is not necessarily of one line or very short, but in this case, by implementing a function that follows a mathematical definition, it is possible to say that it is trivial to translate this definition into a function.

It is also important to mention that if we know the obvious implementation, we have to use it and there is no need for us to go through fake implementation or triangulation.

### One to Many

This pattern is the last one. It doesn't apply here, since it is used when we have data collections and we start from the case of a single element and at the end we generalize for many. But it is good for us to know it because by understanding it, it is obvious that the solution to a problem of this type is easier to reach if we take a specific case to build the general case. This is what is known in logic as **induction**.

## Challenges Encountered

- **Recursion Efficiency.** Recursion is clear and direct, but it can be inefficient for big numbers because of redundant calculations. Considering memoization or an iterative implementation is key to improve performance.

- **Exhaustive Test Coverage.** Ensuring that all variations, from the base cases to higher numbers, are covered by tests is crucial for code robustness.

- **Continuous Refactoring.** Keeping the code clean and modular is essential. It is common that we initially place implementations and tests in the same file, so this process involves moving the `fibonacci` function out of the file containing the tests, in addition to optimizing the code structure.

## Conclusion

This exercise of implementing the Fibonacci sequence using TDD provides us a valuable opportunity to practice development patterns and face common programming challenges. Through the fake implementation, triangulation, the obvious implementation and the one-to-many approach, we not only achieve the right solution, but also refine our ability to think in a systematic and disciplined way. That's why by applying these patterns and practices, we can address complex problems with confidence and clarity.
