üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi!

üí´ This is my personal blog. Here I share all those things that I would have liked to have been available in a concise and easy to understand way when I was struggling with them. I hope people will find the content valuable and interesting and help them on their own journey.

## Tech stack

This blog is self-hosted because... why not? It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using the **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

üí° I made slight adjustments to the newsletter form and simplified the components to only deal with one author, me (you didn't see that coming, I know). I also added support for Spanish and a Dockerfile because, well, `#Dockerrules` (just made that up). Oh, I also fixed some weird hydration error in the navbar (that I probably caused it myself).

## Inspiration

This blog is based on the [template](https://github.com/PxlSyl/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog-i18n) by [PxlSyl](https://github.com/PxlSyl) which added support for i18n. This template is in turn based on the [template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) by [timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx/). At the same time, I also took inspiration from [karhdo.dev](https://github.com/Karhdo/karhdo.dev).

I have to mention that I grealy appreciate the contributions they have made to the community.
